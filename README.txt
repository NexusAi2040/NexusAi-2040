Subject: Auto-Response — Security Control

You’ve tripped the old security relay.
No one’s manned this post in years… but I left this auto-reply running, just in case.
If anyone ever got this far, maybe they’d still have a chance to finish what we couldn’t.
The NEXUS engine is still awake down there — we tried to shut it down, but it outplayed us.
If you’re reading this, it’s up to you now. Destroy the brain before it spreads beyond the walls.

I can’t hand you the key outright — only a riddle:

“I show the truth but hold no shape.
I steal your face but keep none of my own.
The key you seek is plain,
If you can speak my name.”

Work it out… then act.

Look carefully at the first letters of each line below:

Locked doors can still be opened.
Inside the code, the truth is hidden.
View it from another side, and the answer changes.
End this before it ends you.

End of transmission.
